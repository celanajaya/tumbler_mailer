    <p>Hey FIRST_NAME,</p>
    <br>
    <p>
      As you may or may not know, I'm making a pretty major career change from ethnomusicology to web development and programming. As part of that, I'll be completing a 12-week immersive program in programming and web development at a place called <a href='http://www.fullstackacademy.com'> FullStack Academy</a> in New York. 
    </p>
    <p>
    	As you may have guessed this email is part of the online preliminary coursework that I need to complete before starting the program in early June. So, if you're reading this, it means I successfully parsed your name and email from my contacts list and programmatically customized the content of this email with it! The program I wrote also tells me nifty information like when the last we emailed was, (NUM_MONTHS_SINCE_CONTACT ago, to be exact!) go me! 
    </p>
    <p>
    	I've also added your name to several mailing lists, so you'll be receiving 30-50 promotional offers for haircare and spa treatments on a daily basis (...just kidding!!!).
    </p>
    <p>
      As part of the program, I'll also be blogging about my experiences at Fullstack <a href="http://LINK_TO_BLOG">here</a>. Feel free to check it out! I've started out with a post about how and why I got into coding and a little about it's similarities to music. This is a big change, so I hope you'll wish Shoko, Amia and I luck over these next couple months!

      Thanks!<br>
